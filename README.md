# BetterMotherFuckingWebsite

## Architecture and models:

As soon as the site opens, a page is displayed containing a text, itâ€™s about how to improve your own site and make it more attractive.
with this website  we tried to learn how to use css and javascript to make it better .

## Development:

if u want to have a look at th website without clonning it u can try [this LINK](https://meriambs.github.io/BetterMotherFuckingWebsite/).

if you are more interested in knowing the code and maybe add new things  you can clone it using those steps :

1- Under the repository name, click Clone or download.

2- In the Clone with HTTPs section, click to copy the clone URL for the repository.

3- Open the terminal.

4- Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.

5- Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 2.

6- Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

If u dont want to clone it u can try this link it will send u to the website page and u can try it .

## Peculiarity:
On the top right you will find a button (try me) which triggers the " Psychedelique mode ", in fact you will notice changes to the site going through the background, the styles and colors of the paragraphs as well as the headers .

After spending 10 seconds in the site a pop file is displayed it is an advertisement for one of no sponsor, one click sends you to a page and you will discover an interesting video it would be great to go go take a look.
