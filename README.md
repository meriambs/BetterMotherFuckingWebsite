# BetterMotherFuckingWebsite

## Architecture and models:

As soon as the site opens, a page is displayed containing a text, itâ€™s about how to improve your own site and make it more attractive.
With this website, we tried to learn how to use css and javascript making it better.

## Development:

if you don't want to download the webpage, you only have to click on this [Link](https://meriambs.github.io/BetterMotherFuckingWebsite/).

If you are more interested in knowing the code and maybe add new things you can clone it using those steps:

1- Under the repository name, click Clone or download.

2- In the Clone with HTTPs section, click to copy the clone URL for the repository.

3- Open the terminal.

4- Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.

5- Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 2.

6- Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.



## Peculiarity:

On the top right you will find a button (try me) which triggers the " Psychedelique mode ", in fact, you will notice changes to the site going through the background, the styles and colors of the paragraphs as well as the headers.

After spending 10 seconds on the site a pop file is displayed, it is an advertisement for one of no sponsor, one click sends you to a page and you will discover an interesting video it would be great to go take a look.
